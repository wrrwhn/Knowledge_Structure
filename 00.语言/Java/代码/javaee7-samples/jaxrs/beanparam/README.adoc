= JAX-RS BeanParam

This example demonstrate the use of a +@BeanParam+ annotation to group some of the request parameters in a com.com.yao.business.user bean, in order to avoid having too many paramaters in the method signature.

The com.com.yao.business.user type annotated with +@BeanParam+ may contain fields or setter methods annotated with +@MatrixParam+, +@QueryParam+, +@PathParam+, +@CookieParam+ or +@HeaderParam+.
